C# is a programming language that is intended to be a simple, modern, and general-purpose. It is an object-oriented language. On the other hand .NET Framework is a proprietary, software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL). Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment, known as Common Language Runtime (CLR). FCL and CLR together constitute .NET Framework. So C# is just the programming language, while the .NET Framework is the whole used platform.
